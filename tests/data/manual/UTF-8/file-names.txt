Code    Description
-       Not yet tested
OK      OK
a       loaded OK, windows OK, but stdout "Loaded design" message corrupt
b       failed to load, title corrupt
c       failed to import, failure is in lodepng.cpp; it seems that fopen() can't handle UTF-8 paths.
d       failed to load associated JSON file
e       failed to load in FcConfigAppFontAddFile().
f       Limited, maybe only 8859-1 compatible names, rest silently ignored
g       Failed to write
h       Failed to import
i       Primary file OK, name of associated JSON file corrupted
j       Failed to read include file, fopen() failed
k       Silently fails(!); modules are just not found, because stat() fails.
m       Load OK, corrupt console message
n       Various "is not a directory" errors
x       have not been able to test
