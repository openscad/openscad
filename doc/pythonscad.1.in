.SH NAME
pythonscad \- Script-based 3D modeling app with Python support
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pythonscad
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBpythonscad\fP command.
.PP
\fBPythonSCAD\fP is a programmatic 3D modeling application. It allows you to
turn simple code into 3D models suitable for 3D printing.

PythonSCAD is a fork of OpenSCAD which not only adds support for using Python
as a native language, but also adds new features and improves existing ones.

PythonSCAD will start as a graphical program unless export options are given (see
below). For a description of the OpenSCAD language see the OpenSCAD user manual at
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual. For PythonSCAD-specific
documentation visit https://pythonscad.org.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIoutputfile\fP
Export the given file to \fIoutputfile\fP instead of running the GUI. The file
extension specifies the type. If this option is given, the GUI will not be started.
May be used multiple times for different exports. Use '\-' for stdout.

Known extensions: stl, off, wrl, amf, 3mf, csg, dxf, svg, pdf, png, echo, ast, term,
nef3, nefdbg, param, pov.

Additional formats, which are mainly used for debugging and testing (but can
also be used in automation), are AST (the input file as parsed and serialized
again), CSG (an OpenSCAD language representation of the input file with
calculations done and module calls applied), TERM (the constructive solid
geometry expression passed to OpenCSG).  If \fIoutputfile\fP is \fBnull\fP, no
output file will be written, but the file will still be evaluated and all
\fBecho\fP commands will be written to the standard error output. (The
rendering process will still take place if the \fB\-\-render\fP option is
given.)
.TP
\fB\-\-export\-format=\fIformat
Overrides format of exported scad file when using option \fB\-o\fP. \fIformat\fP
can be any of its supported file extensions. For ASCII stl export, specify
\fBasciistl\fP, and for binary stl export, specify \fBbinstl\fP. ASCII export is
the current stl default, but binary stl is planned as the future default so
\fBasciistl\fP should be explicitly specified in scripts when needed.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
Quiet mode (don't print anything except errors)
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIfile.deps\fP
If the \fB-d\fP option is given, all files accessed while exporting are written
to the given deps file in the syntax of a Makefile.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP \fImake_command\fP
If a nonexisting file is accessed during PythonSCAD's operation, it will try to
invoke \fImake_command missing_file\fP to create the missing file, and then
read it again.
.TP
\fB\-O\fP \fIsection/key=val\fP
Pass settings value to the file export using the format section/key=value, e.g
export-pdf/paper-size=a3. Use \-\-help\-export to list all available settings.
More than one \fB-O\fP option can be given.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP \fIvar=val\fP
This option can be used to assign constant values to OpenSCAD variables. The
variable's value is an expression, so if this mechanism is used to assign
strings, care has to be taken that the shell does not consume quotation marks.
More than one \fB\-D\fP option can be given.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIfile\fP
Customizer parameter file.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP \fIname\fP
Customizer parameter set.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Print basic program usage and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\-export\fP
Print list of export parameters and values that can be set via \-O.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
Print version.
.TP
\fB\-\-info\fP
Show which versions of libraries were used to compile the program, and which
OpenGL details are discovered.
.TP
\fB\-\-enable\fP \fIfeature\fP
Enable experimental features. Specify 'all' for enabling all available features.
Available features: roof, input-driver-dbus, skin, lazy-union,
vertex-object-renderers-indexing, textmetrics, import-function, object-function,
predictible-output, wrap-polygon, vector-swizzle, python-engine,
add-parameter-pure-function.
.TP
\fB\-\-backend\fP \fIbackend\fP
3D rendering backend to use: 'CGAL' (old/slow) or 'Manifold' (new/fast) [default].

.SS Image Export Options
.TP
\fB\-\-render\fP
If exporting an image, render the model fully. (Default is preview)
.TP
\fB\-\-preview\fP[=throwntogether]
If exporting an image, use an OpenCSG preview (optionally in throwntogether mode for quicker rendering).
.TP
\fB\-\-animate\fP \fIN\fP
Export N animated frames as PNG images.
.TP
\fB\-\-animate_sharding\fP \fIshard/num_shards\fP
Divide animation work into \fInum_shards\fP and only output frames for \fIshard\fP.
E.g. 2/5 only outputs the second 1/5 of frames. Use to parallelize work on multiple
cores or machines.
.TP
\fB\-\-view\fP \fIoptions\fP
View options: axes, crosshairs, edges, scales.
.TP
\fB\-\-csglimit=\fIlimit\fP
If exporting an image as an OpenCSG preview, stop rendering after encountering \fIlimit\fP elements to avoid runaway resource usage.
.TP
\fB\-\-camera=\fItransx,transy,transz,rotx,roty,rotz,distance\fP
If exporting an image, use a Gimbal camera with the given parameters.
Rot is rotation around the x, y, and z axis, trans is the distance to
move the object in the x, y, and z directions, and distance is the
distance between the camera and the center of the object.
.TP
\fB\-\-camera=\fIeyex,eyey,eyez,centerx,centery,centerz\fP
If exporting an image, use a Vector camera with the given parameters.
The first three are for the Eye position, while the next three are for
the Center (or target) that the camera will look at. The 'up' vector is
not currently supported.
.TP
\fB\-\-viewall\fP
If exporting an image, adjust camera distance to fit the whole design in the frame.
.TP
\fB\-\-autocenter\fP
If exporting an image, center the design in the frame.
.TP
\fB\-\-imgsize=\fIwidth,height\fP
If exporting an image, specify the pixel width and height.
.TP
\fB\-\-projection=\fP[o|ortho|p|perspective]
If exporting an image, specify whether to use orthographic or perspective
projection.
.TP
\fB\-\-colorscheme=\fIscheme\fP
If exporting an image, use the specified color scheme for the rendering.
\fIscheme\fP can be any of \fBCornfield\fP (default), \fBMetallic\fP, \fBSunset\fP,
\fBStarnight\fP, \fBBeforeDawn\fP, \fBNature\fP, \fBDaylight Gem\fP,
\fBNocturnal Gem\fP, \fBDeepOcean\fP, \fBSolarized\fP, \fBTomorrow\fP,
\fBTomorrow Night\fP, \fBClearSky\fP, or \fBMonotone\fP.
