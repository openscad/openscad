Running regression tests:
-------------------------

0) Prerequisites

Install the prerequisite helper programs on your system:

     cmake, python3 (not 2), ImageMagick 6.5.9.3 or newer, diff

There are binary installer packages of these tools available for Mac, 
Win, Linux, BSD, and other systems. (except maybe diff for Win)

Next, get a working qmake GUI build of the main openscad binary working. 
For Windows(TM) this means get a cross-build working from within linux. 
See README.md for how to do this.

Then, install MCAD under openscad/libraries.

$ cd openscad
$ git submodule update --init

A) Building test environment

Linux, Mac:

    $ cd tests
    $ cmake .
    $ make

Windows(TM):

Cross-build from within linux:

64-bit:
    $ source ./scripts/setenv-mingw-xbuild.sh 64
    $ ./scripts/release-common.sh mingw64 tests
    $ # result is .zip file under ./mingw64/

32-bit: 
    $ source ./scripts/setenv-mingw-xbuild.sh 32
    $ ./scripts/release-common.sh mingw32 tests
    $ # result is .zip file under ./mingw32/

B) Running tests

Linux, Mac:

$ ctest               Runs tests enabled by default
$ ctest -R <regex>    Runs only matching tests, e.g. ctest -R dxf
$ ctest -C <configs>  Adds extended tests belonging to configs.
                      Valid configs:
                      Default  - Run default tests
                      Heavy    - Run more time consuming tests (> ~10 seconds)
                      Examples - test all examples
                      Bugs     - test known bugs (tests will fail)
                      All      - test everything

Win:

Unzip the OpenSCAD-Tests-YYYY.MM.DD file onto a Windows(TM) machine. 
There will be a script called OpenSCAD-Test-Console.py in the parent folder.
Double-click it, and it will open a console, from which you can type the ctest
commands listed above.

C) Automatically upload test results (experimental)

It's possible to automatically upload tests results to an external
server. This is good for CI, as well as being able to easily report
bugs.

To enable this feature, add '-DOPENSCAD_UPLOAD_TESTS=1' to the cmake 
cmd-line, e.g.: cmake -DOPENSCAD_UPLOAD_TESTS=1 .

Adding a new test:
------------------

1) create a test file at an appropriate location under testdata/
2) if the test is non-obvious, create a human readable description as comments in the test (or in another file in the same directory in case the file isn't human readable)
3) if a new test app was written, this must be added to tests/CMakeLists.txt
4) Add the tests to the test apps for which you want them to run (in tests/CMakeLists.txt)
5) run the test with the environment variable TEST_GENERATE=1, e.g.:
   $ TEST_GENERATE=1 ctest -R mytest
   (this will generate a mytest-expected.txt file which is used for regression testing)
6) manually verify that the output is correct (tests/regression/<testapp>/mytest-expected.<suffix>)
7) run the test normally and verify that it passes:
  $ ctest -R mytest

Adding a new example:
---------------------

This is almost the same as adding a new regression test:
1) Create the example under examples/
2) run the test with the environment variable TEST_GENERATE=1, e.g.:
   $ TEST_GENERATE=1 ctest -C Examples -R exampleNNN
   (this will generate a exampleNNN-expected.txt file which is used for regression testing)
3) manually verify that the output is correct (tests/regression/<testapp>/exampleNNN.<suffix>)
4) run the test normally and verify that it passes:
  $ ctest -C Examples -R exampleNNN

Troubleshooting:
------------------------------

0. Headless unix servers

If you are attempting to run the tests on a unix-like system but only
have shell-console access, you may be able to run the tests by using a 
virtual framebuffer program like Xvnc or Xvfb. For example:

$ Xvfb :5 -screen 0 800x600x24 &
$ DISPLAY=:5 ctest

or

$ xvfb-run ctest

Some versions of Xvfb may fail, however. 

1. Trouble finding libraries on unix

 To help CMAKE find eigen, OpenCSG, CGAL, Boost, and GLEW, you can use 
 environment variables, just like for the main qmake & openscad.pro. Examples:

 OPENSCAD_LIBRARIES=$HOME cmake .
 CGALDIR=$HOME/CGAL-3.9 BOOSTDIR=$HOME/boost-1.47.0 cmake .
 
 Valid variables are as follows:

 BOOSTDIR, CGALDIR, EIGENDIR, GLEWDIR, OPENCSGDIR, OPENSCAD_LIBRARIES

 When running, this might help find your locally built libraries (assuming
 you installed into $HOME)

 Linux: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib:$HOME/lib64
 Mac: export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib

2. Location of logs
 
Logs of test runs are found in tests/build/Testing/Temporary
A pretty-printed index.html is in a subdir of tests/build/Testing/Temporary
Expected results are found in tests/regression/*
Actual results are found in tests/build/testname-output/*

3. Image-based tests takes a long time, they fail, and the log says 'return -11'

Imagemagick may have crashed while comparing the expected images to the 
test-run generated (actual) images. You can try using the alternate 
ImageMagick comparison method by by erasing CMakeCache, and re-running 
cmake with -DCOMPARATOR=ncc. This will enable the Normalized Cross 
Comparison method which is less accurate but won't usually crash.

4. Testing images fails with 'morphology not found" for ImageMagick in the log

Your version of imagemagick is old. Upgrade, or pass -DCOMPARATOR=old to 
cmake. The comparison will be of lowered reliability.

5. Locale errors

"terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid" 

Is a boost/libstdc++ bug. Fix like so before running:

  $ export LC_MESSAGES=

6. I want to build without OpenGL

 There is an unsupported way to do this, by defining NULLGL to Cmake:

  mkdir nullglbin
  cd nullglbin && cmake .. -DNULLGL=1 && make
 
 The resulting openscad_nogui binary will fail most tests, but may be
 useful for debugging and outputting 3d-formats like STL on systems without GL.
 This option may break in the future and require tweaking to get working again.

7. Proprietary GL driver issues

There are sporadic reports of problems running on remote machines with
proprietary GL drivers. Try doing a web search for your exact error
message to see solutions and workarounds that others have found.

8. Windows + MSVC: 

The MSVC build was last tested circa 2012. The last time it worked,
these were the necessary commands to run.

> Start the 'QT command prompt'
> cd \where\you\installed\openscad
> cd tests
> cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
> sed -i s/\/MD/\/MT/ CMakeCache.txt
> cmake .
> nmake -f Makefile

9. Other issues

The OpenSCAD User Manual Wiki has a section on buildling. Please check 
there for possible updates and workarounds:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual

Please report build errors (after double checking the instructions) in 
the github issue tracker

http://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues

10. Migration away from dedicated regression tests:

In 2013 the test programs underwent a major change. The following notes 
are leftover.

"This test still needs an intermediate script that mangles away timestamps and
near-zero floating point numbers:

* cgalstlsanitytest

Some tests are yet to be converted:

* csgtexttest -- verify whether this is not redundant with dumptest

These look like tests, but are not actually in use:

* modulecachetest
* cgalcachetest
"
