.SH NAME
openscad \- script file based graphical CAD environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B openscad
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBopenscad\fP command.
.PP
\fBopenscad\fP is a software for creating solid 3D CAD objects. It focuses on
CAD aspects rather than artistic ones.

OpenSCAD will start as a graphical program unless export options are given (see
below). For the usage of the GUI and a description of the OpenSCAD language see
the OpenSCAD user manual at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-o\fP \fIoutputfile\fP
Export the given file to \fIoutputfile\fP in STL, OFF, DXF, CSG, or PNG format,
depending on file extension of \fIoutputfile\fP (which has to be lower case).
If this option is given, the GUI will not be started.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIfile.deps\fP
If the \fB-d\fP option is given, all files accessed while exporting are written
to the given deps file in the syntax of a Makefile.
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImake_command\fP
If a nonexisting file is accessed during OpenSCAD's operation, it will try to
invoke \fImake_command missing_file\fP to create the missing file, and then
read it again.
.TP
\fB-D\fP \fIvar=val\fP
This option can be used to assign constant values to OpenSCAD variables. The
variable's value is an expression, so if this mechanism is used to assign
strings, care has to be taken that the shell does not consume quotation marks.
More than one \fB-D\fP options can be given.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show version of program.
.TP
.B \-\-render
If exporting an image, use a full CGAL render. (Default is an OpenCSG compile)
.TP
.B \-\-camera=rotx,roty,rotz,transx,transy,transz,distance
If exporting an image, use a Gimbal camera with the given parameters. 
Rot is rotation around the x, y, and z axis, trans is the distance to 
move the object in the x, y, and z directions, and distance is the 
distance between the camera and the center of the object.
.TP
.B \-\-camera=eyex,eyey,eyez,centerx,centery,centerz
If exporting an image, use a Vector camera with the given parameters. 
The first three are for the Eye position, while the next three are for 
the Center (or target) that the camera will look at. The 'up' vector is 
not currently supported.
.TP
.B \-\-imgsize=width,height
If exporting an image, specify the pixel width and height 
.TP
.B \-\-projection=[o|p]
If exporting an image, specify whether to use orthographic or perspective 
projection
.SH COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES
.PP

Render example001.scad into the .stl format (raw triangle data):
.PP
.B openscad -o example001.stl examples/example001.scad
.PP
Compile a 2d image using a camera rotated 25 degrees in x and 35 in z, 
distance 500, with orthographic projection:
.PP
.B openscad -o o.png o.scad --camera=0,0,0,25,0,35,500 --projection=ortho
.PP
Set the 'mode' variable in example017 so that it will render only the 
parts of the shape. Export to a .dxf file.
.PP
.B openscad -x example017.dxf -D'mode="parts"' examples/example017.scad
