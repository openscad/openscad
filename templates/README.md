Files in this directory define snippets that can be included in a file with a few clicks.

In the editor pane, right click and then Insert Template pops a list of templates.
Double-clicking one inserts the text.

Sample:
```
{
    "key" : "translate",
    "content" : "translate([^~^])"
}
```

* `key` is the name shown in the template list.
* `content` is the content to insert.
* `^~^` is removed and the cursor is left there.

User-defined templates can be added at **[UserConfigPath]**/templates.
