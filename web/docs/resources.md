If you're new to "code CAD" [this short introduction](https://learn.cadhub.xyz/blog/curated-code-cad/) could give you a good overview about the general topic.

William F. Adams has created a nice [PythonSCAD wiki](http://reddit.com/r/openpythonscad/wiki/index) which contains a lot of useful information.

Also check out our own [tutorial](tutorial/getting_started.md)

Python Stub files for all available functions in PythonSCAD can be found [here ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythonscad/pythonscad/refs/heads/master/libraries/python/openscad.pyi)
