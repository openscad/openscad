# Get started

If you're new to the concept of "code CAD", please first [read this short introduction](https://learn.cadhub.xyz/blog/curated-code-cad/) and browse the plethora of already existing solutions to this problem space.

Before downloading, please understand that "Python | OpenSCAD" is a fork currently maintained by myself, gsohler.
I sincerely wish for this fork/branch to be merged into mainline OpenSCAD and I have been working towards making it happen. [You can follow the progress here](https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/4841).

There are several benefits to using Python over OpenSCAD's DSL (domain specific language):

  1. Faster general computation due to faster interpreter
  2. Utilize any pip packages
  3. More familiar syntax
  4. More familiar computation model


Hopefully these benefits will help draw more people to the wonderful world of PythonSCAD!

Ok, now it's probably a good idea to [download](downloads.md) it.
