# Commits listed in this file will be ignored by github in "blame" view.  
# This feature is still in public beta at time of writing, 2022-03-27.
# See Github docs here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view

# This file may also be used when running git blame locally (git v2.23+):
#   git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs

# Any mass-formatting / whitespace-only types of changes should ideally be listed in this file

# Run uncrustify (via scripts/beautify.sh --all). 2022-02-06 by t-paul
